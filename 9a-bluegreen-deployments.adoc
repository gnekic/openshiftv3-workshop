Blue-Green Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:data-uri:

The purpose of this short lab is to demonstrate how simple it is to
implement Blue-Green Deployments in OpenShift v3.

"_Blue-green deployment is a release strategy that can be utilized by
developers for deploying software in a production environment. Blue can
be one particular production environment whereas green can define an
identical production environment. Under blue-green deployment strategy,
software developers are able to minimize downtime and reduce risk._"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nuqing/Blue-green_deployment[1*]

In this Lab, we will be:

* Deploying two versions of the same application. The first version will
display a blue rectangle.
* Create a FQDN that can be used to expose the applications.
* We will first expose the first application.
* We will also create another version of this application in the same
project that displays a green rectangle.
* We will then switch the FQDN to from the first application (blue) to
the second application (green).

Part I
^^^^^^

*Step 1: Create a new project*

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.
IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with your username

- login to web UI via https://master.ocp.tauil.org
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Create Project`

image::new-project.png[image]

- Enter `bluegreen-*userxx*` as project name (all lower case)

image::new-project-details.png[image]

- Click `Create`


*Step 2: List existing image builder or image streams*

- Click `Add to Project`  --> select `Browse Catalog`
- Click `PHP`
- Click drop down from the version under PHP and get the list of image stream

*Step 3: Create an application*

We will be using a sample application that displays a blue or green
rectangle. The sample app can be browsed at https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen

We will be using an env var in order to change the color of the box; but
in practice you would use a different branch for each version of the
code. (E.g. v1 branch and v2 branch)

- Click `Add to Project`  --> select `Browse Catalog`
- Click `PHP`

image::php-catalog.png[image]

- Click `Select` in the PHP option with the default version
- Enter name as `blue`
- Enter Git Repository URL as https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen

- Click `advanced options` link below to expand the options area
- Scroll down to `Deployment Configuration` session
- Add `COLOR` as key and `blue` as value

- Scroll down and click `Create`



*Step 4: Monitor the application build*

- Click `Builds` --> `Builds`
- Click onto `#1`
- Click `Logs` tab


  Once the build finishes you should see something similar to:

  ...
  Pushing image docker-registry.default.svc:5000/guide/blue:latest ...
  Pushed 0/6 layers, 2% complete
  Pushed 1/6 layers, 27% complete
  Pushed 2/6 layers, 40% complete
  Pushed 3/6 layers, 53% complete
  Pushed 4/6 layers, 73% complete
  Pushed 4/6 layers, 92% complete
  Pushed 5/6 layers, 97% complete
  Pushed 6/6 layers, 100% complete
  Push successful
  ...

*Step 5: Check application deployment status*

- Click `Applications` --> `Pods`
- Pods `blue` shows `Running` Status

Notice that the build pod has Completed and you now have a single instance
of the application running under one single pod.

This application displays a blue square.

*Step 6: List the service*

- Click `Applications` --> `Services` to view all services


*Step 8: Test the application*

- Click `Overview`
- Click route link on the top right on the screen

At this point you have deployed an application that displays for
illustration purposes a blue rectangle for version 1.

Part II
~~~~~~~

In this part, we will:

* Deploy a new version of this application (Same one as before with a
very small change)
* Point the previously created FQDN (route) to the new service that will
be created as part of the new application creation process.

image::blue_green_active_green.png[image]

*Step 1: Create new version of the application*

Create a new application the same way as you did above in Part I. Make
sure to name the application as 'green' this time.

- Click `Add to Project`  --> select `Browse Catalog`
- Click `PHP`
- Click `Select` in the PHP option
- Enter name as `green`
- Enter Git Repository URL as https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen
- Click `advanced options` link below to expand the options area
- Scroll down to `Deployment Configuration` session
- Add `COLOR` as key and `green` as value
- Scroll down and click `Create`


* Wait until the application is built and deployed. You should now see
two services on Overview


*Step 2 Edit service*
Edit the previously created route and change the `service` name (from
`blue` to `green`), all the way at the bottom to the new service that
was just created. You are essentially still using the FQDN you had
previously created. However, that route will now point to a different
(green) service.

- Click `Applications` --> `Routes`
- Click `blue`
- Click `Actions` --> `Edit`
- Select `green` under Service
- Click `Save`


*Step 2: Test the application*

- Click onto the Route URL

* You should now see the new version of the recently deployed
application with a green rectangle.

[[summary]]
Summary
~~~~~~~

* Blue-Green deployments can be easily accomplished in OpenShift v3.
* We have shown multiple versions of an application; all running
concurrently, each with a unique service.
* All that is needed to expose any of the applications is to change the
service being used by the route to publicly advertise the application.
